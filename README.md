- **GitHub CLI**: Leverage existing `gh` CLI authentication  
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically selects the best available authentication method
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Seamlessly switches between authentication methods when one fails
  - Primary: PAT authentication (if configured)
  - Fallback: GitHub CLI authentication (if available)
  - Zero user intervention required during authentication failures
  - Maintains consistent API responses across authentication methods

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This tool runs as an MCP server in your local environment.
You can use it with tools like Copilot Agent or any MCP-compatible client.

### Requirements

- Node.js installed
- VSCode with an MCP-compatible extension (e.g., Copilot Agent)

## üîê Authentication System

### Recommended: GitHub CLI Authentication  
```bash
gh auth login  # One-time setup
npx mcp-gh-pr-mini  # Works immediately
```

### Alternative: Personal Access Token
Set the environment variable `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` if you prefer PAT authentication.

**Required PAT Permissions:**
| Permission | Access Level |
|------------|--------------|
| **Pull requests** | **Read & Write** |
| **Issues** | **Read & Write** |
| Metadata | Read (automatic) |

### Configure in `settings.json`

#### With GitHub CLI Authentication
```jsonc
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "mcp-gh-pr-mini": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-gh-pr-mini"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### With Personal Access Token
```jsonc
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "mcp-gh-pr-mini": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-gh-pr-mini"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "{Your Fine-Grained GitHub Token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîê Authentication Details

### Dual Authentication System
This MCP server features an intelligent dual authentication system that automatically detects and uses the best available authentication method:

### GitHub CLI (Recommended) ‚≠ê
- **Seamless Integration**: Uses your existing GitHub CLI authentication
- **Universal Support**: Works with all GitHub CLI authentication methods (OAuth, PAT, SSH)
- **Zero Configuration**: No additional token setup required after `gh auth login`
- **Enterprise Ready**: Full support for organization SSO and SAML
- **Automatic Detection**: Server detects GitHub CLI availability and authentication status

### Personal Access Token (Alternative)
- **Direct API Access**: Uses GitHub's REST API with personal access tokens
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Supports fine-grained personal access tokens for precise permissions
- **Required Permissions**:
  * **Pull requests**: Read and write
  * **Issues**: Read and write  
  * **Contents**: Read and write
- **Fallback Ready**: Automatically used as fallback when GitHub CLI is unavailable

### Authentication Flow üîÑ
1. **Detection Phase**: Server checks for available authentication methods on startup
2. **Priority Selection**: Personal Access Token is preferred (if configured) for consistency
3. **Automatic Fallback**: If PAT fails or is invalid, automatically switches to GitHub CLI
4. **Transparent Operation**: Users never see authentication errors - fallback happens seamlessly
5. **Consistent Experience**: All MCP tools work identically regardless of authentication method used

### Tested Scenarios ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **PAT Only**: Works with valid personal access tokens
- ‚úÖ **GitHub CLI Only**: Works with GitHub CLI authentication alone
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches from invalid PAT to GitHub CLI
- ‚úÖ **Mixed Environments**: Handles scenarios where one method becomes unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of authentication failures without user disruption

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow Example
```typescript
// 1. Create a pull request
create_pull_request({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository",
  title: "Add new feature",
  body: "Description of the changes",
  head: "feature-branch",
  base: "main"
})

// 2. Get the diff to review changes
get_pull_request_diff({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository", 
  pr_number: 1
})

// 3. Add a general comment
add_pr_comment({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository",
  pr_number: 1,
  body: "This looks great! Just a few small suggestions."
})

// 4. Add a specific code review comment
add_review_comment({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository",
  pr_number: 1,
  body: "Consider using const instead of let here for immutability.",
  path: "src/index.ts",
  position: 15
})

// 5. Request reviewers
request_reviewers({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository",
  pr_number: 1,
  reviewers: ["reviewer1", "reviewer2"]
})
```

### Working with Comments
```typescript
// Get all comments to review feedback
get_pr_comments({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository",
  pr_number: 1
})

// Get file changes to find reviewable positions
get_pr_changes_for_commenting({
  owner: "username", 
  repo: "repository",
  pr_number: 1
})
// Returns positions where you can add review comments
```

### Repository Management
```typescript
// List all open PRs to get an overview
list_open_pull_requests({
  owner: "username",
  repo: "repository",
  limit: 5
})
```

## üí° Best Practices

### Authentication Setup
1. **Use GitHub CLI for convenience**: Run `gh auth login` once and forget about tokens
2. **PAT for CI/CD**: Use Personal Access Tokens in automated environments
3. **Test authentication**: Verify with `gh auth status` before using the tools

### Comment Management
- **AI Identification**: All AI-generated comments are automatically prefixed with "[AI] Generated using MCP"
- **Position-specific comments**: Use `get_pr_changes_for_commenting` first to find valid positions
- **Review workflow**: Get diff ‚Üí identify issues ‚Üí add targeted review comments

### Error Handling
- **Authentication failures**: The system automatically falls back between methods
- **Invalid PRs**: Tools gracefully handle non-existent PRs or repositories
- **Network issues**: Built-in retry logic for transient failures

## ü§î Why?

This project provides a minimal, focused implementation for essential pull request tasks via MCP.
It's designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a good reference for building MCP servers.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

#### "Authentication failed" or "Unauthorized"
1. **Check GitHub CLI status**: Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication
2. **Re-authenticate GitHub CLI**: Run `gh auth login` to refresh credentials
3. **Verify PAT permissions**: Ensure your personal access token has required permissions:
   - Pull requests: Read and write
   - Issues: Read and write  
   - Contents: Read and write
4. **Test with a simple command**: Try `gh pr list` in a GitHub repository to verify CLI access

#### "Repository not found" 
- **Verify repository access**: Ensure your authentication method has access to the target repository
- **Check repository name**: Confirm owner and repository name are spelled correctly
- **Private repository access**: For private repos, ensure your token/CLI has appropriate permissions

#### Authentication Method Priority
The server uses this fallback order:
1. **Personal Access Token** (if `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set)
2. **GitHub CLI** (if `gh auth status` succeeds)
3. **Error** (if neither method is available)

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid position for review comment"
- Use `get_pr_changes_for_commenting` first to find valid positions
- Position numbers correspond to lines in the diff, not the original file
- Only modified or added lines can receive review comments

#### "Pull request not found"
- Verify the PR number exists and is accessible
- Check if you have read permissions for the repository
- Ensure the PR hasn't been deleted or moved

#### MCP Server Connection Issues
1. **Restart VSCode**: Sometimes MCP connections need to be refreshed
2. **Check settings.json syntax**: Ensure your MCP configuration is valid JSON
3. **Verify npx installation**: Run `npx mcp-gh-pr-mini --version` to test
4. **Enable debug logging**: Add `"DEBUG": "true"` to environment variables

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by adding debug environment variable:

```jsonc
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "mcp-gh-pr-mini": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-gh-pr-mini"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

This will show detailed authentication flow and API calls in the MCP server logs.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check authentication**: Verify both `gh auth status` and token permissions
2. **Test with minimal example**: Try listing PRs in a public repository first
3. **Review debug logs**: Enable debug mode to see detailed error information
4. **File an issue**: Include debug logs and specific error messages
