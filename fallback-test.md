# GitHub CLI Authentication Fallback Test

This file is created to test the authentication fallback mechanism in the MCP GitHub PR mini tools.

## Test Scenario
- PAT has been regenerated and is now invalid
- GitHub CLI is properly authenticated
- Testing if MCP tools automatically fallback to GitHub CLI authentication

## Expected Behavior
- PAT authentication should fail
- System should automatically fallback to GitHub CLI
- All PR operations should succeed via GitHub CLI

## Test Results
- Will be updated during testing...
